# Women's Clothing Review
This project implements a machine learning model for predicting women's clothing reviews using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The algorithm is widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is particularly suitable for text classification tasks with discrete features.
# Overview
Customer reviews play a crucial role in understanding product satisfaction and customer sentiment. This project aims to automatically classify and predict reviews of women's clothing into predefined categories using machine learning techniques.
# Key Features
1] Text Classification: Categorizes textual reviews into classes based on their content.

2] Multinomial Naive Bayes: Utilizes a probabilistic model suitable for handling text classification tasks.

3] Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares textual data for model training.

4] Model Training and Evaluation: Trains the model on labeled data and evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

5] Python Implementation: Implemented in Python using the Scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks.
# Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:-
1] data/: Directory containing sample datasets or pointers to datasets used for training and testing.
2] models/: Directory to store trained models or model checkpoints.
3] Colab/: Google Colab for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
4] src/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
5] README.md: Overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage details.
# Usage
1] Data Preparation:-Place your dataset or update paths in the src/data_preparation.py script.
   Run data preprocessing scripts as needed.

2] Model Training:-Use the provided notebooks or Python scripts in src/ to train the Multinomial Naive Bayes model on your data.

3] Model Evaluation:-Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4] Deployment:-Optionally, deploy the trained model for real-time predictions or integrate it into other applications.
