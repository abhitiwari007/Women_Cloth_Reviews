In Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is a familiar topic in academia and literature today. The best research on e-commerce has mainly focused on emerging countries. Consumer behavior research is gaining prominence as consumers move from visiting retail stores to online shopping from an e-commerce perspective.

In this Dataset, a study is considered in sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate, implement, and analyze the most effective methods. Potential models now play an important role in a wide range of research tasks, including data classification and data acquisition necessary for scale prediction.

This project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to explore broad features in written consumer opinions. The purpose of this project is to determine whether consumers use the information in their review text to recommend the product they purchased.

One of the challenges in this project is extracting useful information from the variable "Review Text" using text mining techniques. Another challenge is that text files must be transformed into mathematical feature vectors in order to run machine learning algorithms.
